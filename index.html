        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Do you ever remember being asleep or uninspired in class? Mundane lectures, repetitive tasks, and tedious homework have been common observations of anybody passing through grade school for many generations. How can we reinvigorate education and catch it up to the cutting-edge world of technology? The implementation of augmented reality technologies has displayed the potential to revolutionize public education around the world.</p>
        <p>Aurasma, a London, UK based startup that was acquired in 2012 by HP, has been the industry leader in creating augmented reality programs for use in business and education. Aurasma software, open source and thus accessible to both teachers and students, has gained attention as helping to bring life to classwork material and to create new ways to learn outside of the classroom. “Aurasma includes an intuitive, drag-and-drop AR creation studio... we are laser-focused on ease of creation, and users with no formal technical training can build, launch, share, and track their own augmented reality campaigns” says the head of Aurasma, Annie Weinberger. Current uses of Aurasma in education have included a program with which students scan homework, revealing a video of a teacher helping them solve that problem, and to record book reports or notes in sections in books that can be accessed by scanning the particular title or page of the book. These unique and innovative ideas are just breaking the surface; the possibilities are endless, and only time will tell how much more interactive and exciting work in the classroom can become through the use of augmented reality.</p>

        <h3>Geology and Navigation</h3>
        <p>The first ever use of augmented reality was an astounding twenty-three years ago, when the Rockwell International Conglomerate developed a groundbreaking astronomical navigation software for the US Military. The software, called the Debris Correlation program, was a program that overlaid calculated trajectories of orbital debris and a constantly refreshing map of the positions of astronomical bodies and satellites to detect debris dangerous to these satellites. Presently, as navigation technology has reached an unparalleled, almost perfect degree of detail, it’s the ideal time to start implementing AR technology in geology and navigation. </p>

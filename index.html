        <p class="title-desc">Augmented reality is the use of computer-generated sensory information to supplement a view of the physical world. It ‘augments’ reality in real time, resulting in a rendered and interactive presentation of this information so that the computer generated information becomes one with the real world. Its uses and benefits are infinite, but as with any technology, it’ll come at a cost.</p>

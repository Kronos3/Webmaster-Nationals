        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Do you ever remember being asleep or uninspired in class? Mundane lectures, repetitive tasks, and tedious homework have been common observations of anybody passing through grade school for many generations. How can we reinvigorate education and catch it up to the cutting-edge world of technology? The implementation of augmented reality technologies has displayed the potential to revolutionize public education around the world.</p>
        <p>Aurasma, a London, UK based startup that was acquired in 2012 by HP, has been the industry leader in creating augmented reality programs for use in business and education. Aurasma software, open source and thus accessible to both teachers and students, has gained attention as helping to bring life to classwork material and to create new ways to learn outside of the classroom. “Aurasma includes an intuitive, drag-and-drop AR creation studio... we are laser-focused on ease of creation, and users with no formal technical training can build, launch, share, and track their own augmented reality campaigns” says the head of Aurasma, Annie Weinberger. Current uses of Aurasma in education have included a program with which students scan homework, revealing a video of a teacher helping them solve that problem, and to record book reports or notes in sections in books that can be accessed by scanning the particular title or page of the book. These unique and innovative ideas are just breaking the surface; the possibilities are endless, and only time will tell how much more interactive and exciting work in the classroom can become through the use of augmented reality.</p>

        <h3>Geology and Navigation</h3>
        <p>The first ever use of augmented reality was an astounding twenty-three years ago, when the Rockwell International Conglomerate developed a groundbreaking astronomical navigation software for the US Military. The software, called the Debris Correlation program, was a program that overlaid calculated trajectories of orbital debris and a constantly refreshing map of the positions of astronomical bodies and satellites to detect debris dangerous to these satellites. Presently, as navigation technology has reached an unparalleled, almost perfect degree of detail, it’s the ideal time to start implementing AR technology in geology and navigation.</p>
        <p>One pioneering augmented reality navigation technology was Wikitude’s 2010 Wikitude Navigation suite. Wikitude is one of a few closed-source augmented reality platforms, and it was the first to enter the field of commercial navigation. Using user-generated and Google-collected street view maps, it is the first platform that will allow users to get directions with a street view picture of their directions. As of now, it has only been used as a mobile app, but it is expected that this app will soon be available on several augmented reality wearable technologies. Wikitude’s CMO Andy Gstoll summed up the impact of its navigation suite; “augmented reality navigation systems hold tremendous potential for developers working with wearable display technology... Hands Free navigation without the use of maps provides numerous practical and safety benefits.”</p>

        <h3>Medicine</h3>
        <p>The field that requires the most tactical precision, and in which a single mistake can create a life-threatening situation is medicine. Surgery and location of tiny subcutaneous veins (those entirely under the skin) has been an issue in the medical world, especially in remote areas where access to electricity is an issue. However, augmented reality implementation has proven an easy fix to this problem too.</p>
        <p>The Near-infrared Vein Finder is a groundbreaking technology that simplifies locating veins and even smaller parts of the nervous system. It uses visual electromagnetic radiation which is on the borderline of being classified as infrared to project a map of the nervous system onto the skin, and to use the dimensions of the body part being observed to carefully calibrate this. This technology is still in its early phase of development; it still costs around $15,000, and it is still not any more effective than conventional techniques in placing catheters or sensory tubes into the body. However, it is easy to see why medicine will benefit from augmented reality. Surgeons could rely on similar projections all over the body to prevent errors, and could even rely robotic surgery technology that uses augmented reality viewpoints to carefully pinpoint exact locations of the body that require care.</p>

        <h3>Industry and Planning</h3>
        <p>The fields of commercial and industrial design have traditionally always been at the forefront of imaging technology. The first Computer Aided Design software was used to design parts for airplanes, and ever since, computer-generated artistic renderings, in-depth blueprints and plans, and tensile-strength and destructive-testing software have all become commonplace and available in different forms for people in all fields. Just as industrial and commercial design led the way for technologies widely used today, they will pave the way to the widespread use of augmented reality. </p>
        <p>The first use of augmented reality in design was by Boeing in the 1990s. They used a simplistic head-mounted display so that workers on the factory floor could superimpose drawings of parts onto unfinished assemblies, and so they could make individual modifications to ensure that they fit together correctly. It was a crude and basic technology, but it has since blossomed into one of the leading manufacturing technologies. Factory workers from companies ranging from those manufacturing large machines, like Volkswagen, all the way to companies making electrical parts and computer chips, like Texas Instruments. </p>
        <p>Not only is augmented reality used in such settings for the mechanization of manufacturing, but it is also used for maintenance, quality control and training. In maintenance, augmented reality is used to provide information regarding problem areas, and can generally be used as a way by which to isolate the user’s vision and direct all attention to the problem area. Companies can also use augmented reality to perform quality control, using semi-mechanized processes to assess the same component of various products to take notice of any deformities and to in turn isolate the deformed product. And lastly, there is really no better way to train employees and adjust them to life in the industrial setting than to use augmented reality to simulate the tasks and precision with which they would have to perform them, and this has already made for several key improvements in manufacturing technology that cannot go unnoticed. Learning the cognitive and fine-motor subskills needed in the workplace is a huge advancement that augmented reality will support.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Do you ever remember being asleep or uninspired in class? Mundane lectures, repetitive tasks, and tedious homework have been common observations of anybody passing through grade school for many generations. How can we reinvigorate education and catch it up to the cutting-edge world of modern technology? The implementation of augmented reality technologies has displayed the potential to revolutionize public education around the world.</p>
        <p>Aurasma, a London, UK based startup that was acquired in 2012 by HP, has been the industry leader in creating augmented reality programs for use in business and education. Aurasma’s software, which is open source and thus accessible to both teachers and students, has gained attention in helping to bring life to classwork material and to create new ways to learn outside of the classroom. “Aurasma includes an intuitive, drag-and-drop [augmented reality] creation studio... we are laser-focused on ease of creation, and users with no formal technical training can build, launch, share, and track their own augmented reality campaigns” said the head of Aurasma, Annie Weinberger. Current uses of Aurasma in education include a program with which students can scan a homework problem, revealing a video of a teacher showing how to solve it, and to record book reports or notes on sections of books that can be accessed by scanning the particular title or page of the book. These unique and innovative ideas are just breaking the surface: the possibilities are endless, and only time will tell how much more interactive and exciting work in the classroom can become through the use of augmented reality.</p>

        <h3>Geology and Navigation</h3>
        <p>The first ever use of augmented reality was an astounding twenty-three years ago, when the Rockwell International Conglomerate developed groundbreaking astronomical navigation software for the US Military. The software, called the Debris Correlation program, was a program that overlaid calculated trajectories of orbital debris and a constantly refreshed map of the positions of satellites to detect debris dangerous to these satellites. Presently, as navigation technology has reached an unparalleled, almost perfect degree of detail, it’s the ideal time to start implementing augmented reality technology in geology and navigation.</p>
        <p>One pioneering augmented reality navigation technology was Wikitude’s Wikitude Navigation suite, first introduced in 2010. Wikitude is one of a few closed-source augmented reality platforms, and it was the first to enter the field of commercial navigation. Using user-generated and Google-collected street view maps, it is the first platform that will allow users to get directions with a street view picture of their route. As of now, it has only been used as a mobile app, but it is expected that this app will soon be available on several augmented reality wearable technologies. Wikitude’s CMO Andy Gstoll summed up the impact of its navigation suite: “Augmented reality navigation systems hold tremendous potential for developers working with wearable display technology… Hands Free navigation without the use of maps provides numerous practical and safety benefits.”</p>

        <h3>Medicine</h3>
        <p>Medicine is a field in which precision is a must, and in which a single mistake can create a life-threatening situation. Surgery and location of tiny subcutaneous veins (those entirely under the skin) have been an issue in the medical world, especially in remote areas where access to electricity can’t be taken for granted. However, augmented reality implementation has proven an easy fix to this problem too.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.abc2news.com/news/region/howard-county/new-technology-making-it-easier-to-find-veins-on-children-in-howard-county&sa=D&ust=1494719753359000&usg=AFQjCNEa7wYZJsP5PRBex0qBGxbBSnTi9Q">Near-infrared Vein Finder</a> is a groundbreaking technology that simplifies locating veins and even smaller parts of the nervous system. It uses visual electromagnetic radiation which is on the borderline of being classified as infrared to project a map of the nervous system onto the skin, and to use the dimensions of the body part being observed to carefully calibrate its map. This technology is still in its early phase of development; it still costs around $15,000, and it is still not any more effective than conventional techniques in placing catheters or sensory tubes into the body. However, it makes the case for augmented reality in medicine. Surgeons could rely on similar projections all over the body to prevent errors, and could even rely on robotic surgery technology that uses augmented reality viewpoints to carefully pinpoint exact locations of the body that require care.</p>

--Project N.I.N.A.
-Hyperion has produced a solution that uses revolutionary artificial intelligence technology designed to get you from Point A to Point B faster, cheaper, and safer than ever before. NINA is a state-of-the-art transportation system that provides unrivaled privacy and comfort. The AI allows efficient communication between cars to regulate traffic and adapts to your daily routine. More importantly, it is built with eco-friendly materials and emits zero greenhouse gases. NINA offers the comfort of personal vehicles with the convenience of public transport, creating a transportation system fit for the modern age.

--Space
-One of the greatest benefits of the NINA is the amount of space it provides for storage. Since the NINA fits into a specific niche—a large autonomous taxi-like service—the NINA should have ample room to store what passengers have, whether it be a small backpack or even a bicycle. Unlike a traditional automobile, the NINA runs on electrical power and does not have an internal combustion engine. As a result, where the engine would be, space is converted into storage area. Approximately 25 ⅓ cubic feet in the front is made available for storage in the front, in addition to significant trunk space in a normal location in the rear. While the NINA does need to store basic fluids—windshield washer fluid and coolant—the area where the engine would have been is miraculously freed for space.

--Interior
-Public transportation is infamous for being dirty. Mice run amuck in subway systems and bed bugs can infiltrate any bus seat. NINA makes sure that every customer travels in clean conditions by using cutting-edge UV rays to kill germs. In contrast to traditional cleaning products that can irritate skin, UV rays are emitted between rides to make sure every germ in every inch of the vehicle is killed.

--Cleaning System
-In order uphold high Hyperion standards, the NINA makes sure that every customer travels in clean conditions by using cutting-edge UV rays to kill germs. In contrast to traditional cleaning products that can irritate skin, UV rays are emitted between rides to make sure every germ in every inch of the vehicle is killed. While UV rays don’t deal with solid debris, the NINA’s stain-proof seats and all-weather floor mats assure that the car will stay clean and any accumulating dirt will be contained. While cleanliness may be the greatest deterrent to riding public transportation in a city, the NINA subverts this issue by striving towards high standards and a cleaner commuter society.

--AI system
-Perhaps the most important AI feature of the Hyperion NINA is its ability to learn. Just like a regular human driver, the NINA gets better at navigating roads, odd traffic stops, and unmarked turns with time. As the vehicle travels down the road, a series of ultrasonic sensors detect various moving and fixed objects with no blind spots. In this sense, the NINA is at an inherent advantage— the car can perceive everything, and unlike a human, doesn’t have to guess to maneuver the car in certain tight spaces. Above all, however, the NINA slowly picks up on the city layout and grid as it logs driving hours. Since ultrasonic sensors, analogous to eyes on a human, are linked to a central computer in the car which stores ultrasonic reception and links it to geographic markers. As routes are repeated, the car can continue to build a virtual picture of reality, adding minute details one step at a time.

-While each individual NINA unit has the potential to learn and improve from its own experiences on the road, each vehicle computer is also linked to a central database, analogous to the brain and nervous system of a human. Based on the perception of new signs, barriers, and obstructions on the road, each individual NINA unit adds in real time new terrain markers and signals. Consequently, a NINA five miles away can be alerted about a car crash in real time and reroute to save both time and energy. By learning from itself and other cars, the NINA is capable of being a dynamic instrument that lives and grows, rather than leading a stagnant lifestyle with a distinct product lifespan.

--Safety, and liabilities
-While the Hyperion NINA offers many groundbreaking benefits, it is also important to recognize the inherent challenges associated with any car based on an AI system. For example, Uber has encountered various problems with its automated driving systems, often attributing accidents to the fault of other cars without the same driving skills. The skill associated with an automated and law-abiding driver is both a extreme benefit and a flaw. While the AI system can predict and avoid crashes and constantly maintain proper following distance and speed, the system also initially lacks knowledge to behave like a human on the road. Many interactions between drivers involve eye contact and hand gestures, all of which are difficult to replicate, even in an advanced AI system. As a result, one main system liability is the standstill—in which the NINA is perpetually stuck in place behind a stalled car, or waiting for a car to turn. Without the innate human nature of driving, the NINA system could potentially encounter a few bumps in the road.

-Of course, these problems would arise only in the evanescent stages of learning and development in the NINA AI. Since the system, like a human, is capable of perceiving, committing to memory, but also improving and learning over time, certain technicalities and stalling effects could be limited within months time.

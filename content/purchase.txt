--Cost
-In terms of cost, units would be expensive and would push around $150,000 retail value. Since the Hyperion is equipped with an interior comparable to that of an electric car, and autonomous driving, the cost of implementation and maintenance is rather high. Nevertheless, since the cars are autonomous, no labor cost is needed to pay a driver to operate the car, and no taxi badges are necessary for the car considering that no driver exists. Moreover, by charging each rider a variable fee, depending on conditions, rush hour traffic, and distance, school campuses or municipalities can quickly earn money back on their large investments.

-Since city governments and large universities invest in various drivers for shuttles and vehicle cost, a purchase of the Hyperion NINA would come at a significant financial benefit to both groups. While the initial cost of the NINA is substantially higher than a generic Dodge Caravan or Ford Transit, the NINA would be far more used and popular, let alone efficient. First of all, the NINA would not need a human operator in the car, reducing yearly budgets by tens of thousands of dollars. In addition, these shuttles and public transport systems run nearly incessantly, meaning that huge amounts of gas and diesel are being burned on a yearly basis. With electrical power, emissions are cleaner, but institutions can save thousands of dollars in just one year by ceasing to use gas. The NINA is a prescient solution to a growing problem of congested public transportation. Over time, the NINA will only continue to improve in AI, and will save institutions thousands of dollars in the long run, and tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the process.
